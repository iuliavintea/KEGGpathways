# KEGGpathways
Extract gene names from KEGG database. 
Following pathways/metabolisms were searched in KEGG pathway database: lipid peroxidation, redox metabolism, iron metabolism and mevalonate pathway. The entries that contained those pathways/metabolisms were selected. The KEGG genes() were copied in a .txt file. From those .txt files the gene names were extracted to further be added to the complete ferroptosis related genes list.
